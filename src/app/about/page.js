          Homeownership is a huge part of our economy. Housing overall is a $33
          trillion business, and mortgages account for $15 trillion. Yet home
          finance operates in the same way it has for decades â€” through opaque
          systems and expensive intermediaries whose interests are misaligned
          with consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&#39;s why Better.com is redefining the homeownership process from
          the ground up. We&#39;re using technology to make it faster and more
          efficient, and humans to help make it friendly and enjoyable.
